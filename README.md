# withExtraPropAdded, withPointlessHOC, withFavorite Number

    -Created three different higher order components. withPointlessHOC is just an
    example of a Higher Order Component and the general structure, withExtraPropAdded
    is an outline of a HOC that has a prop added to it and withFavoriteNumber is part
    of a challenge exercise where you can print your favorite number on screen by
    referencing the extra prop added. You reference the extra prop added directly by
    the name you chose for the prop, not by referencing the component.
